Iris Data Set is probably the most versatile, easy and resourceful dataset in pattern recognition literature.
Nothing could be simpler than the Iris dataset to learn classification techniques. The data has only 150 rows & 4 columns.

Objective:
Present a generic methodology to model the different characteristics of real data.
Describe the evaluation criteria to evaluate the quality of the classifiers.
Compare different classifiers using their default parameters.
Examine the influence of each classifier parameter on the discriminability of the data
Examine the performance when all classifier parameters are varied jointly.
